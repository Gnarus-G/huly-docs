Access your Inbox by clicking on the bell icon in the left sidebar. A red dot at the corner of the bell icon indicates unread notifications.

Your Inbox displays all of your messages, Document mentions and  Issue assignments.

### Direct messages

New messages appear here when they are received. You can open, read and reply to messages in your Inbox without leaving the page, but all of your conversations can also be found in the [Chat](../../team-workflows/chat) view, accessed by the speech bubble icon in the left sidebar.

Hovering over a message will reveal a few options:
* **Emoji** - reply to a message with an emoji
* **Bookmark** - save a message (adds the message to your saved messages in the Chat view)
* **Pin** - pins the message to the top of the chat
* **Speech bubble** - reply to the message in a thread

### Documents

Any Documents that you have been mentioned in will appear hear. You can open and view these Documents without leaving the page, but they are also accessible in the Documents view, accessed by the file icon in the left sidebar.

Here, you have the same options available to you in the [Documents](../../team-workflows/documents) view.

### Issues

Any Issues assigned to you will appear here, as well as any comments that have been added to those Issues. You can view the Issue without leaving the page, and can access the same options that are available in the [Issues](../../team-workflows/issues) view.

### Cleaning up your Inbox

Selecting the settings icon on the top right of the Inbox sidebar opens a dialog for toggling Unreads and Archived, allowing you to filter messages in your Inbox by only unread or archived messages.

The next icon with the three dots opens a dialog for bulk actions, allowing you to mark all messages as read or unread, or archive all of your messages.

You can also click the circular checkbox next to any message to archive it. Additionally, you can click the three vertical dots to open a dialog with options to mark it as unread, archive it or unsubscribe from notifications about that thread, Document or Issue.
