### What are Issues?

Issues represent specific tasks that need to be completed. Because Issues are assigned to one member at a time, they should be small in scope. Issues are organized into Projects, which define larger portions of work that a team needs to complete.

Whenever an issue is created with a status of "Todo" and is assigned to a team member, the system automatically generates a [Todo](../team-workflows/todos.mdx) in that member's Planner, allowing them to add it to their own schedule.

### Creating Issues

Select the Tracker view by clicking the checkbox icon on the left sidebar, and ensure the side panel is open by clicking the horizontal lines at the top left.

Click the blue `+ New Issue` button at the stop of the side panel. This will open a dialog where you can enter some initial settings for your Issue. After entering your desired settings, click `Create issue`.

#### Issue settings

**Project**: In the top left corner of the dialog, you will see the Project that this Issue is associated with. Click on the name of the Project to see a dropdown where you can choose to select a different Project to associate with this Issue.

**Issue title**: A title for your Issue.  

**Description**: A description of your Issue. Descriptions may be formatted with markdown formatting, including headers, codeblocks, links and more.

**Issue status**: It is recommended to set your Issue status to "Todo" when it's first created.  

**Priority**: Choose from No priority, Low, Medium, High or Urgent.

**Assignee**: Select a member to assign this Issue to. When you create an Issue assigned to a member, that member will recieve a [Todo](../team-workflows/todos.mdx) in their Planner that will allow them to add it to their own schedule.

**Default Issue status**: Select the status all new Issues should default to when they are created.

**Labels**: Add labels for this Issue or add new ones. This is optional, but can be helpful for sorting Issues later.

**Estimation**: Add an estimation for how long this Issue will take to complete. This is optional, but is a helpful tool for workflow tracking and scheduling.

**Due date**: Select a due date for this Issue. This is also optional, and its usefulness will depend on your team's specific use case.

**Set parent Issue**: Make this Issue the sub-issue of an existing Issue.

**Attach**: Attach a file, image or other media to this Issue.

### Viewing Issues

##### List and Kanban Views
The default view for Issues is the List view, where Issues are listed in order of their status. Huly also offers the option for a Kanban view, which displays Issues in a column format. To toggle between the two views, click either the List or Kanban icon in the top right corner of the window.

##### Sorting, filtering and searching
Options for sorting and filtering issues can also be found in the top right corner. The `View` button allows for configuration of some viewing settings as well as options for sorting how issues are grouped and ordered on the page. The `Show` button displays toggles for showing and hiding Issue details. 

The `Filter` button, next to the search bar, offers options for filtering Issues. The search bar can be used to search for a specific Issue by keyword.

For quick sorting, select `Active`, `Backlog` or `All` from the menu above the search bar.

**Add a sub-issue**: Add a sub-issue directly to the Issue you are viewing.

**Link icon**: Copies a link to the Issue to the clipboard.

**Side panel icon**: Opens the right side panel, which contains information about the Issue.

### Tips for creating effective Issues

There are so many ways to customize Issues to suit the needs of your specific projects and workflows! However, there are a few tips to keep in mind as you create Issues for your team.

- Issues should be small in scope, representing a task assigned to just one person.
- All new Issues should have a status of "Todo" to trigger the system to create a Todo for the assigned team member.
- In keeping with best practices, an Issue status should never need to be manually changed from "Todo" to "In Progress" or "Done". Rather, the status of an Issue should automatically be determined by the assigned team member's Todo status. For more on how this process is automated, read more about Todos here.
