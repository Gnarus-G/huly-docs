Huly offers many options for team members to communicate directly within the Huly platform without the need for an external app. Hulyâ€™s Chat functionality allows team members to exchange messages in real time through direct messaging and shared channels.

### Ways to chat

There are a few different ways to chat with team members on Huly:
* **Channels** - Public or private chatrooms based on topics or themes
* **Direct Messages** - Instant messaging between individuals or groups
* **Documents** - When you are mentioned in a document, the document will appear in your Chat view where you can continue the conversation privately with the team member who tagged you.
* **Issues** - Similar to documents, any Issue assigned to you appears in this section. Replying to an Issue in this thread adds a comment to that Issue, which is visible to all team members.

There are also a few ways to sort and filter messages to quickly find what you're looking for:
* **Threads** - Messages that you've replied to
* **Saved** - Messages that you've saved
* **Browser** - View, search and filter messages, channels, files and contacts

### Notifications

New messages will appear in your Inbox, and you'll see a red dot by the bell icon indicating you have a new notification. These settings can be changed by clicking on your profile icon in the lower right corner, selecting `Settings` and then `Notifications`.

### Creating a channel

Create a new channel by clicking the `+` button at the top of the Chat sidebar and selecting `New channel`. Enter a name and description for your channel and select either `Public` or `Private` for visibility. Click `Create`.

To make your channel visible to other team members, add them to the channel by clicking `Add members` in the right sidebar.
