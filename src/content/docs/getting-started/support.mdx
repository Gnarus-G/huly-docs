Our goal is to create documentation that covers all features, concepts and capabilities of the Huly platform. However, Huly Docs is still in development, and some features may not be covered. There are several ways to learn more about Huly and get support.

### Huly YouTube Channel

We are steadily adding to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUaG4fhRtAVWmsw1Q9PvgWw" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> to include more feature previews and comprehensive tutorials. This is a great place to start when looking for a quick overview of a key feature of the platform. We're also working on adding to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMzYL2rxqZPNcCh03t5L_BTeOMhVRQcLD" target="_blank">Huly Tutorial</a> series, which will cover more in-depth demonstrations and step-by-step instructions.

### Stay up to date on Twitter/X

Feature previews and exciting changes are often shared first on <a href="https://x.com/huly_io" target="_blank">Twitter/X</a> before they're even released! Following us on Twitter/X is a great way to stay up to date, and it also serves as a great platform to show us what you're building with Huly, engage with content you want to see more of, and share about Huly within your own network.

### Huly Community on Slack

For technical support and questions about Huly, the best place to reach out is through our Huly Community <a href="https://hulycommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-29kl7zmwz-2b3RRVTiWhhtAwzHjBm3Wg#/shared-invite/email" target="_blank">Slack channel</a>. Here, you can get in touch directly with our CEO/founder and engineering team. We're eager to help you get set up and ensure you get the most out of the Huly platform!

The Huly Community is also an excellent way to get inspiration from other Huly users and to share your feedback. Our goal is to make Huly adaptable to any kind of team and workflow, so we're eager to learn from your unique insights. We hope to see you there!
