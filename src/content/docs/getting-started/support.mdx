Our goal is to create documentation that covers all features, concepts and capabilities of the Huly platform. However, Huly Docs is still in development, and some features may not be covered. For further guidance, check out some of our other helpful resources below:

### Huly YouTube Channel

We are constantly adding to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUaG4fhRtAVWmsw1Q9PvgWw" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a> to include more feature demos and guided tutorials. This is a great place to start when looking for a quick overview of a key feature of the platform. We're also working on adding to our <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMzYL2rxqZPNcCh03t5L_BTeOMhVRQcLD" target="_blank">Huly Tutorials</a> series, which includes more in-depth demonstrations and step-by-step instructions to help you get the most out of your Huly setup.

### Stay up to date on Twitter/X

Feature previews and exciting changes are often shared first on <a href="https://x.com/huly_io" target="_blank">Twitter/X</a> before they're even released! Following us on Twitter/X is a great way to stay up to date, and it also serves as a great platform to show us what you're building with Huly, engage with content you want to see more of, and share about Huly within your own network.

### Huly Community on Slack

For community support and questions about Huly, the best place to reach out is through our Huly Community <a href="https://hulycommunity.slack.com/join/shared_invite/zt-29kl7zmwz-2b3RRVTiWhhtAwzHjBm3Wg#/shared-invite/email" target="_blank">Slack</a>. Our Founder/CEO and engineering team are active in the community and we always appreciate hearing feedback from our users. Our hope is for our Slack community to bring Huly users together to learn, ask questions and share perspectives. We hope to see you there!
