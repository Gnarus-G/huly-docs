### Creating your first Workspace

When you first sign up for an account on Huly, you will be prompted to create a Workspace.

A Workspace is the foundation of the Huly platform, representing the virtual space where your team will be working.

Give your Workspace a name and click `Create`.

### Inviting team members to your Workspace

Once your Workspace has been created, you can invite team members to join.

Select your profile icon on the bottom left of the sidebar. Then, select `Invite to workspace`. Select `Get invite link` to reveal the invite link. From there, you can copy the link, which you can share with your team members.

> ##### Configuring invite settings
> 
> Workspace invite links come with some default settings. To configure these settings, open the settings panel by clicking on the horizonal marks at the top left of the sidebar. Select `Invite settings` in the settings panel. Here, you can configure settings for your workspace invitations, including the duration the link will be valid for, email mask and limit.

### Workspace settings

To configure Workspace settings, open the settings panel by clicking on the horizonal marks at the top left of the sidebar. The following settings can be configured:

> **Owners**: Set roles for all team members as User, Maintainer or Owner.  
> **Branding**: Add a custom logo for your Workspace.  
> **Invite Settings**: Configure settings for Workspace invitations.
