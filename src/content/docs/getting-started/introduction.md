Huly is an open source all-in-one project management platform offering an alternative to tools like Linear, Jira, Slack, Notion, and Motion. 

By providing a powerful suite of features including workflow management, personal scheduling, collaborative editing and video conferencing, Huly streamlines project management processes in a way that aligns seamlessly with the complexity and dynamic nature of real-world workflows.

Huly Docs contains information about all of Huly's main platform features. You can also read more about the philosophy behind Huly on our [blog](https://huly.io/blog/symphony-of-productivity/).
