### What are todos?

Todos are tasks that are assigned to a specific team member. They are created automatically when an issue is created with a status of "Todo" and assigned to a team member. Todos are added to the member's Planner, where they can be scheduled and tracked.

Todos are a unique feature of the Huly platform. You can learn more about the concept behind todos on our <a href="https://huly.blog/huly-todos" target="_blank">blog</a>. Todos are also covered more in depth in our tutorial video:

### Creating todos

Todos can be created automatically, manually in your own Planner, or directly from within documents.

##### Todos automatically created for an issue
A todo is automatically generated by the system when an issue is created with an assignee and the status set to “Todo”. This todo will appear in the Planner of the assignee, and a notification will appear in their inbox. This is the recommended way to create a todo because it directly links to the issue and allows for tracking of the issue's status, while ensuring an individual team member is responsible for the todo's completion.

##### Creating a todo in your Planner
Todos can be created in your own personal Planner without being attached to any particular project or issue. Creating a todo in this way may be helpful for a team member to manage small personal tasks that don't directly relate to an issue and don't necessarily need to be visible to the rest of the team.

To create a todo in your Planner:
* Navigate to the Planner view by clicking on the calendar icon in the left sidebar.
* Click on the text field and enter a title for your todo; press enter to save. Your new todo should now appear in your Planner in the “Unplanned” section.

##### Assigning todos directly from a document
For more on creating and assigning todos directly within documents, check out this [guide](../../knowledge-management/documents-todos).

### Completing a todo

When the task associated with a todo is complete, the todo can be marked as complete by clicking the round checkbox that appears when hovering over the todo on the Planner. This will change the status of the associated issue to “Done” and will move the todo to the "Done" section of the Planner.
