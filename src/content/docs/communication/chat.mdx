Huly offers many options for team members to communicate directly within the Huly platform without the need for an external app. Hulyâ€™s chat functionality allows team members to exchange messages in real time through direct messaging and shared channels. Chat is also integrated with the rest of your workspace, so documents, issues, pull requests and other workspace objects can be accessed directly from chat.

### Ways to chat

There are a few different ways to chat with team members on Huly:
* **Channels** - Public or private chatrooms based on topics or themes
* **Direct messages** - Instant messaging between individuals or groups
* **Documents and issues** - From chat, you can access all activity on documents, issues and other workspace objects. With everything in one place, it's easy to keep track of changes and participate in discussions without bouncing back and forth between chat and other views. For more on how to manage workspace activity within chat, see [Activity tracking in chat](../chat-activity).



### Notifications

New messages will appear in your Inbox, and you'll see a red dot by the bell icon indicating you have a new notification. These settings can be changed by clicking on your profile icon in the lower right corner, selecting `Settings` and then `Notifications`.

### Creating a channel

Create a new channel by clicking the `+` button at the top of the Chat sidebar and selecting `New channel`. Enter a name and description for your channel and select either `Public` or `Private` for visibility. Click `Create`.

To make your channel visible to other team members, add them to the channel by clicking `Add members` in the right sidebar.
