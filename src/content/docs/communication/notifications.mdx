---

Access your notification settings by clicking your profile icon in the bottom left corner and selecting `Settings`. From the settings menu, select `Notifications`.

### Sound and appearance

At the top of the settings menu, select `Sound and appearance` to set some global settings for notifications. Here, you can toggle notification sound, icon bounce and badge, or turn off all notifications entirely.

### Notification settings

For more granular control over the kinds of notifications you'll receive, select a space or object from the list in the left sidebar. There, you can select which kinds of updates you'd like to receive notifications for, as well as how you'd like to receive them — in your Huly inbox, by email, and/or push.
