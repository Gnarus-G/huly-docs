Here, you have the same options available to you in the [Documents](../../knowledge-management/documents) view.

### Issues

Any issues assigned to you will appear here, as well as any comments that have been added to those Issues. You can view the issue without leaving the page, and can access the same options that are available in your Tracker.

### Cleaning up your inbox

Selecting the settings icon on the top right of the inbox sidebar opens a dialog for toggling Unreads and Archived, allowing you to filter messages in your inbox by only unread or archived messages.

The next icon with the three dots opens a dialog for bulk actions, allowing you to mark all messages as read or unread, or archive all of your messages.

You can also click the circular checkbox next to any message to archive it. Additionally, you can click the three vertical dots to open a dialog with options to mark it as unread, archive it or unsubscribe from notifications about that thread, document or issue.
