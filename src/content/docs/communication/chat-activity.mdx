title: Activity tracking in chat
description: Learn how to keep track of workspace activity within chat.
---

Chat is the central communication hub at the core of Huly, where team members can communicate not only through direct messaging and group chat channels, but also collaborate on projects and resources. Documents, issues and other workspace objects appear in the chat of all associated team members, so members can see updates, discuss details and make decisions alongside the rest of their chat conversations.

### Viewing workspace activity in chat

In the left sidebar of your chat, you'll find sections labeled `Documents`, `Issues`, and any other task types you've created. These sections will display all of the associated objects that you've either created, been assigned, or been mentioned in.

Open any object to see the activity history. Issues and other task types will also display any comments that have been added.

Sending a message from the chat view will automatically add a comment to that issue or task, and vice versa â€” comments added to an issue will appear in the chat.

### Syncing with GitHub

If you've connected a project to GitHub, you'll see a special `Pull Requests` section in your chat sidebar. This section will display all of the pull requests associated with your project, and you can open any pull request to see the activity history and comments. Just like comments and activity on the task itself, anything added here in the chat will sync with GitHub.
